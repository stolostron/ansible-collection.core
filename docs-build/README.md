# Plugins Documentation Build

Scripts in this folder can extract docs from the plugins and generate some rst files.

This folder is originally generated by using `antsibull-docs sphinx-init --use-current --dest-dir  docs-build stolostron.core`. Some modifications are added to the generated version:
- locked antsibull version to 0.30.0 to make generated rst files can display properly on github.
- updated some arguments such as `--squash-hierarchy`.
- removed sections of generating html files.

If you are running the command for the first time, please install all the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To generate rst files, run the following command:
```
./build.sh
```
After running, rst files will be generated in the temp-rst folder.
